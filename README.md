# BLACKJACK

Blackjack is the ultimate casino table card game. 

Luck is always very important, but the game also requires careful consideration of strategy and patience. Remember, the goal of Blackjack is to beat the dealer and win as much money as possible, not to get as close to 21 as you can.

**The rules of the game are pretty simple:**

1. The dealer will give you two blackjack cards and show one of his cards.
2. You have an option to add more blackjack cards by choosing 'HIT' but you lose automatically if your value of cards exceeds 21.
3. Click 'STAND' when you are ready to play the hand.
4. The dealer will reveal his hidden blackjack card and must always hit if they have 16 or lower. They will stop hitting if they have 17 or more.
5. You win when the combined value of your cards is greater than that of the dealer.
